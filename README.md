# Introduction

Currently runs with:

- Angular v12.0.2
- Electron v13.0.1
- Electron Builder v22.10.5

/!\ Angular 12.x CLI needs Node 11 or later to work correctly.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kyoz/i18nice.git
```

Install dependencies with npm:

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload!

The application code is managed by `app/main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200), and an Electron window. \
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import. \
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `app/main.ts`.

## Commands

|Command|Description|
